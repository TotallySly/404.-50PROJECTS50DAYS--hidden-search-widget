## 404.- 50 Projects 50 Days - Hidden Search Widget

### What was the project about?

The project is part of the 50 Projects in 50 Days with Brad Travesy via Udemy. The course is a code-a-long to further cement skills used within HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This particular project was making a hidden search widget. The user intially sees the universial search widget icon, the magnifying glass. Upon clicking, the widget expands and the seach input is displayed, allowing the user to type in their search option

This project was rather simple compared to the other projects. It only relied on a couple of CSS transitions and the toggle method within JavaScript.

#### CSS

I didn't learn anything new using CSS. I just solidified a little bit more knowledge regarding the transition property.

#### JavaScript

As with the CSS, there was not really a new aspect to learn per se. The eventListener added a toggle method, to add or remove the active class.

Additionally, the .focus() method was something new. However, this method is rather simple. It places the focus onto a specific element. In this case, the input to allow the user to search.
